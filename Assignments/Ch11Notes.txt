**Prop Drilling
    -- when we pass props to component parent to child and childen to grand child and so on...
       hence we need to pass props in component which might not need it.
    -- and whenwever props get changed it will make those component.

**Liftingl the state up
     -- when we control child elements by parents state.
      like in accodian component we pass state and setfuntion to child and
      on button click we change state in parent.

**in functional component we use useContext hook to use Context.
  in Class components we use <ContextName.Consumer> component we wrap the component with
  <ContextName.Consumer> and access context keys/values using 'value' key.

**and change in context state make components to re-render whichever component is using
context.

**to update context we use <ContextName.Provider> component and it takes props(new state or key/value)
in 'value' key.
**we wrap the component where we want this new content value. 
Best practice is to wrap whole application in <ContexName.Provider>.
