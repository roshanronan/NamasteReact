.React Redux and Redux Toolkit

React Redux is like bridge b/w react and redux.
React Toolkit is like core of redux creating store and slices.

configure store
    configureStore() from rtk
create slice
    createSlice() from rtk

    createSlice({
        name:'cart',
        initialState:{
            items:[]
        },
        reducers:{
            addItem:(state,action)=>{
                state = action.payload
            }
        }
    })

    export const {addItem, clearItem} = cartSlice.actions
    export default cartSlice.reducer;

--put the slice in store
    {
        reducer:{
            cart:cartSlice,
            user:userSlice
        }
    }
--- reading data from redux store
 we need to subscribe redux store using useSelector hook

const cartItem = useSelector(stroe =>store.slicename.initialState)

---updating data of redux store
on button click we all funtion that  dispatch an action this action calla reducer that updates the redux store slice



const dispatch = useDispatch()
 
 //addItem is action from slice
functionCall on  btn click (item)=>{
    dispatch(addItem(item))
}
