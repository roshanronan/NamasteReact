1 - Diffenect b/w Named exprot , default exprot and * as 

    export default Button              -> import Button from './button' //here we can import as any name you want it will give you same funtion.
                                          const Button = require('./button').default
    
    export const Button                -> import { Button } from './button'//named import must be with name speficied in export file.
                                          const { Button } = require('./button')

    **
    if a file have default export as well as named export
    we can import as
    import DefaultExport ,{NamedImport} form 'exported file'

    *** 
    when we have multiple named export from file so here we can import
    as named import or we can import all from that file using * as
    import * as ANY_NAME form '..exproted file path'
    now you can access method or funtion 
          ANY_NAME.funtion

             
    export { Button }                  -> import { Button } from './button'
                                          const { Button } = require('./button')
             
    module.exports.Button              -> import { Button } from './button'
                                          const { Button } = require('./button')
    
    module.exports.Button = Button     -> import { Button } from './button'
                                          const { Button } = require('./button')
    
    module.exports = Button            -> import * as Button from './button'
                                          const Button = require('./button')
