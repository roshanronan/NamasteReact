            path:'/profile'              // then it will be  like > "localhost:1234/profile"

// Class based component is important topic for interview.
Ther are three main thing 
    Mounting -> Updating -> Unmounting

constructour -> render -> componentDidMount -> componentDidUpdate -> componentWillUnmount.
constructour():
first thing to in constructour is to call "super(props)" and then initailze the state object.

render():
render method will render the components if render method find a child component then child life cylce
method will be called in above mentioned order.

componentDidMount() :
componentDidMount this method called after the render for the first time it runs only for one time.
here we make api calls.

componentDidUpdate():
This method runs whenever there is a change in state and props of component. 

componentWillUnmount:
This method get called when user move to another component.It is used for cleanup method or api called
in componentDidMount.


//In class based component "this" keyword shared amoung all life cycle methods. and help access to
common shared variable.
for example: if we create a setInterval in component did mount method to clear that setInterval 
we to remove when component will Unmount using component will Unmount method.
    code ex //in comp did mount
              this.timer = setInterval(()=>{},1000)
            //in comp will Unmount
              clearInterval(this.timer)


// In function based component when we  setInterval in useEffect here we also need to clear those 
things. so retrun a function from useEffect. and this return will call when we load or move to another
component.
    useEffect(()=>{
      console.log('useEffect') //logs after the render of comp

      return ()=>{
        console.log('useEffect return')//this will log when we move to another comp
      }
    },[]) 



//class life cylce 

 **** most importent part of class based component is render method. and it is only mendatory method of class
 based component.In class component render method returns some JSX.

(Research HW) In class based component we need to create state
constructour(props){
    super(props)
  }

why?/
