1 - What is JSX?
	JSX is html like syntex that is used to create react elements and react components.It look like html tags but JSX is totally
	different from html. You can write javascript code in it in curly braket{} it accept any valid javascript expression.
	
2 - Superpower of JSX
	1. As it look like html tags so it is easy to understand although jsx have some extra attribute that understand by react only.
	2. Component Composition : we can use one component in another component.
	3. Re-usebility: Jsx used to create components that are highly reusable. we can create some component and can use in another component
		using Component Composition.
	4.It help reactdom to create dom manupulation and updation fast, as jsx compoent have keys attribute using that reactdom decide which component to
	  mount and unmout.
	5.XSS Safe: cross site script is not possible as reactdom escapes and sanetize the code that passed to react component.
	
3 - Roll of type attribute in script tag? what options can i use there?
	Type attribute in script is used to specify the mime type of the script and identify the content of the tag.
	Script tag in html page is used to specify which type of script will be used in the page. so that browser interprate accordingly.
	below can be use in type attribte
		 -module - This value specfiy that code must be treated as javascript module and the processing of the script content is deffered.
				   in module script we can use import and export, to import funtion from another file and export to another file.
		 -importmap - the import map below defines a "module specifier map" JSON object where the property names can be used as module specifiers, and the
            		 corresponding values will be substituted when the browser resolves the module URL. The values must be absolute or relative URLs.
		 <script type="importmap">
        {
          "imports": {
          "shapes": "./shapes/square.js",
          "shapes/square": "./modules/shapes/square.js",
          "https://example.com/shapes/": "/shapes/square/",
          "https://example.com/shapes/square.js": "./shapes/square.js",
          "../shapes/square": "./shapes/square.js",
                 }
        }
       </script>
	   It specify that the script in a import map means it contains a json object having key value pair. where key are used as module name to import methods 
	   from value which specfiy a file.
	   
4 -  {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent> </TitleComponent>}
     Ans:
	 {TitleComponent} signifies  TitleComponent will treat as javascript variable inside a jsx. and if 
      TitleComponent is a compoent it will give an error saying Funtion is not a valid react child.
      or you can call it as {TitleComponent()} this will work as normal jsx.

	 {<TitleComponet/>} signifies TitleComponent is a funtion that return a JSX that will render on dom.
     
     {<TitleComponent> </TitleComponent>} signifies TitleComponent is a funtion that return a JSX that will render on dom.
