1 - What are various ways to add images into our app? Explain with example?
	We can import images in React component as below:-
		1. import <any_name> from 'path_to_img'
				use - <img src={any_name}/>
		2. import * as <any_name> from 'path_to_img'
				use - <img src={any_name.name-of-image}/>
		3. Or we can use directly in img Jsx as below
				use - <img src = {require('path_to_img')} />
		4. Import {<any_name> as ReactComponent} from 'path_to_img'
				use - use - <img src={any_name}/>
				
	
2 - What would happen if we do console.log(useState())?
	Here on console we will get an array of length 2 .
		first one is the default value passed to useState and second is a function().
	
3 - How will useEffect behave if don't add a dependency array?
	If we don't pass a dependency array in useEffect hook, then according to it's default behaviour it will call the effect (callback funtion 
	passed to useEffect) on every render of the component in which we are using useEffect. And an empty array passed to useEffect will reset 
	its default behaviour and it will call effect only once after the initial render of component. 
	
4 - What is SPA?
	SPA stands for single page application. SPA is a implemention of web application that loads a single web
	document, and then updates the body content of that single document using javascript apis such as fetch and
	XMLHttpRequest.
		This therefore allow users to use website without loading whole new page on very interaction or routes.
	
5 - What is the differnce between Client side routing and Server side routing?
	In Server side routing , when a user click on a link then browser makes an http request for that page
	on server now server process the request and send a response usually a html page, now bowser discard the 
	old page and loads the new page.

	In client side routing , when use click on a link , now client side code catches the event look for the
	the like if the url is not an external then it prevents the browser to make  request.
	then routing library changes the url in brwoser with help of html histroy api and routing libary changes
	the states and loads component on client side. sometimes if it require client app request data from server
	only data not pages, and loads new component on client side.
