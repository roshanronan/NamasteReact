    To configure tailwind within react project(with parcel bundler)
        we need to install tailwind and a postcss libary : npm install -D tailwindcss postcss
        after intalling we need to run : npx tailwindcss init
        now we a tailwind.config.js file in this file in content key we pass the files path with
        extention regex .
        also we need to create a postcss file with name .postcssrc 
        and in this file we need to mention 
                                             {
                                               "plugins": {
                                                 "tailwindcss": {}
                                               }
                                             }

    Content : it contains the path of the html , js and template files where tailwind
              classes will be used.
    
    Theme :  It contains the project color palette,type scale ,fonts,breakpoints and border radius
             value and more.
    
    Extend: It is used for to extend the default theme.
            by adding new/extra breakpoints or all the thing that is under theme.

    Plugin: Extending Tailwind with reusable third-party plugins.Plugins let you register 
            new styles for Tailwind to inject into the userâ€™s stylesheet using JavaScript
            instead of CSS.
