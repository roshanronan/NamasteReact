1. Caret(^) and tilde(~) in package.json before a library version
   package name :(~/^) package version
   Here package version is written as 3.4.5 like Major.minor.patches
   ^ means it will automatically update for minor updates for the package
   ~ means it will automatically update for patches and bug fix.

2. Package-lock.json vs Package.json
   Package.json cantains the package version detail for development environment of our project 
   and Package-lock.json cantains package version(exact version) detail for production environment.
   It locks the package version and should naver to put in gitignore file.

3. Npx means execute using npm. 
   When we use npx it not install the library to your local system.
   Npx downloads the package for runtime and then delete it.

4.Bundlers
   React use bundler(webpack) for code compression and convert our react code to single html,css and js,that our
   browser understand.

   Bundlers like viti,webpack and parcel.
   Bundlers provide many features to react app that help to make production ready app.
   Some features of Parcel bundler are--
      1.HMR-hot module replacement.
      2.File watcher alogrithm which are written in c++
      3.Code minify
      4.Code compression
      5.Create server for local environment
      6.Tree shaking - remove un wanted code . like we install a package and it can have many funtions but we use
        2 or 3 funtions so bundler help in cleaning by tree shaking.
      7.Image optimization
      8.Super fast build alogrithm 
      9.Caching while development
      10. Compatible with older version of browser(by creating polyfills)
      11.https on dev
      12.manages port number
