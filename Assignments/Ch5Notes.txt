// React follows ONE WAY data binding.
suppose a component have a input field and there is a variable have value

let inputValue = 'roshan'

<input name='abc' value= {inputValue}>

now in ui there will be roshan in input field all the time it won't change.
so to make change we need to use onChange funtion to change value.

<input name='abc' value = {inputValue} 
onChange={(e)=>{
    inputValue = e.target.value
}}>

now if you see input on your ui there is value "roshan" but if you try to enter 
any other value it wont change.
    because due to one-way binding when you change the value input field it won't change in inputValue 
    variable. so every time component rerender onChange funtion call it render with initial value.

//what is state?? why is state??

In react normal variable like above example , react can't track there value change so create use 
variables that called state and state change makes react to re-render the component.
So State is special kind of react variable that are use to store value in react component.
and react always watches state variable/.


//what is hooks ?? why is hooks??
Hooks in React is funtion and every hooks have some special power to create special variable in 
funtional component. 

What is useState()?
useState is one of the hooks that provided by react and it is used for create state variables in
react funtional component. It returns a array with two element in it. 

const [variableName,setVariableName]= useState("default_value")
