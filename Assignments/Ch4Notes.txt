React.Fragment is like empty tag.
as we don't want extra div in our jsx we can use React.Fragment or <></>.
and <> JSX code </> and <React.Fragment> Jsx code </React.Fragment> 
and <> </> is short hand of react.Fragment.So both are same.

HW. can we use react.fragment inside react.fragment??
Yes we can have but there is no any affect. it will be same as using single react.fragment.

Config Driven UI.?

Reconciliation is process of updating Real Dom when there is change in state of any component in react.
before update real dom, react compare Current Virtual dom to previous Virtual dom using diffing algo and then 
make required updates in real dom.

React fiber??

Reconciliation engine?
