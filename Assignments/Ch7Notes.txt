1.Never write one funtional compnonet inside another compnonet, cause that componet will be created on every render
and it will make our app performance bad.

2.Never write a useState in if block and for loop, cause it will create uninconsistent.

3. React provide useState hook to create local variable in compnonet.
   so never use useState outside of funtional component.

4.we can use useEffect as many as we need according to our use case.


//
To use routing we need to create router configuration

we use createBrowserRouter from react-router-dom
router config created using createBrowserRouter 


// while creating nested routes in router config
 we need use Outlet component which is provided by react router dom
 and all children routes goes in Outlet and Outlet component used where we want our child routes.

// dynamic routing means means with id params 
we need to use hook call useParams from react router dom


//SPA - Single Page Application
there are 2 types of routing 
 1. client side routing - in react we do client side routing as when we move about to contact page that happen on
 client side.
 2. server side routing - here when we move about to contact or any page that page data come from server, earlier 
 website uses this routing.
