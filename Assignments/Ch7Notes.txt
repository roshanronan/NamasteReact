1.Never write one funtional compnonet inside another compnonet, cause that componet will be created on every render
and it will make our app performance bad.

2.Never write a useState in if block and for loop, cause it will create uninconsistent.

3. React provide useState hook to create local variable in compnonet.
   so never use useState outside of funtional component.

4.we can use useEffect as many as we need according to our use case.
